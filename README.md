# SP-Live-Indicator

SP-Live-Indicator is WebSocket-based and tracks fronting alters and updates an emoji list based on their status. It uses the API to fetch and manage member data

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (or yarn)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BellaBeaBaby/SP-Live-Indicator
   cd SP-Live-Indicator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file in the root directory\
 Replace `YOUR_SP_READ_TOKEN` with the actual token token and `YOUR INDICATOR FIELD NAME` with the name of the custom field you want to track.

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The application will fetch member data and listen for live updates via WebSocket. 
3. The list of emojis will be logged in the console whenever thereâ€™s a change in the front members' live status. 

Of course you can replace this with whatever implementation you have planned.\
I may add some implementations of my own in the future
